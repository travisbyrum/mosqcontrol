\usage{
control(
  counts,
  time,
  mu = 1/14,
  m = 3,
  n_lam = 25,
  kmax = 20,
  global_opt = 0,
  n_pulse = 4,
  rho = 0.3,
  days_between = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Numeric vector of population counts.}

\item{time}{Numeric vector with corresponding day of year measurments.
Example: Jan 1st = day 1.  Must be same length as \code{counts}.}

\item{mu}{Numeric indicating natural population death rate.}

\item{m}{Numeric indicating number of lifetimes for population decay
between seasons}

\item{n_lam}{Numeric max fourier mode order to calculate.}

\item{kmax}{Numeric max number of dynamics fourier modes to use in calculating
fourier sum (different than N_lam = max emergence fourier mode set by user
for curve fitting portion of the code. Kmax should be an integer between
2 and 200, default at 20.}

\item{global_opt}{Numeric set to 0 if user chooses local optimum, 1 if user
chooses golbal GN_DIRECT_L_RAND method, 2 if user chooses global
GN_ISRES method.}

\item{n_pulse}{Numeric number of pulses, set by user, integer between
1 and 10.}

\item{rho}{Numeric percent knockdown (user set between .01 and .30,
e.g. 1\% to 30\% knockdown).}

\item{days_between}{Numeric minimum number of days allowed between pulses
set by user (integer bewtween 0 and 30 days).}
